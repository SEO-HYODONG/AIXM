.......how to java

To generate java classes from the AIXM xsd files using JAXB tool xjc, do:

xjc -b binding.xjb ./schema/* -extension

where schema is the directory containing the xsd files, and binding.xjb is in directory one up from it.

Note:
due to conflicts with capitalised names I had to change the following names
in defaultStyle.xsd in ISO_19130_Schemas directory.

featureStyle -> featureStyleProp
geometryStyle -> geometryStyleProp
topologyStyle -> topologyStyleProp
labelStyle -> labelStyleProp
graphStyle -> graphStyleProp
