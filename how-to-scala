......how to scala

for scala you need to put the xsd files in the following directory structure:
src/main/xsd

modify the pom.xml to reflect the desired scala version etc..,
then using maven to generate the source files type:

mvn generate-sources


to compile, type:

mvn compile

(however this does not compile)
